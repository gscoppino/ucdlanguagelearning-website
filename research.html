            <h1>Background</h1>
            <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
            <p>
            Early Education Teachers
            Early Education Students
            Parents of Early Education Students
            </p>
            <h2>Stakeholder Profiles</h2>
            <p>
            Early Education Teachers
            The mobile application will be designed for teachers to use as a tool for teaching vocabulary words, syllables concepts, letters and sounds. Because the app will include games that are suitable for young children, the teachers using the app will likely be early education teachers.
            Early Education Students
            The application will be designed for children between the ages of three and six years old. Most of these students are preparing for learning how to read by learning letters and combinations of letters.
            Parents of Early Education Students
            While parents are not the direct users of the application, they may passively be involved in the studentâ€™s coursework, and have an interest in the app being appropriate, as well as safe, for their children to be using.
            </p>
            <h1>Methods</h1>

            <h2>Interviews</h2>
            <p>
            Population: Teachers
            </p>
            <p>
            Basis: Individual interviews with teachers would allow us to have a better understanding of what they expect from such an app. They would also be able to clarify the challenge of having the right design for young kids.
            </p>
            Recording Techniques: We could record these interviews using an audio recording device.
            <p>
            Method: Find a way to contact a representative sample of early education teachers and request participation in the research study. Acquire consent from these teachers for recording information during their individual interviews, and introduce them in better detail to the study. Assemble a team of interviewers and split the sample among them, hopefully with the same amount of interviews per interviewer. The interviews will be semi-structured interviews, since we already have a general idea of the app we are building. We are trying through these interviews to ensure we've considered all the relevant factors in our design. Have these interviewers record the data artifacts from the interviews using a combination of handwritten notes and an audio recording device.
            </p>
            <p>
            Resources:
            A team of interviewers such that there are more teachers than interviewers, and each interviewer interviews roughly the same amount of teachers.
            </p>

            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>
            Population: Teachers, Students
            </p>
            <p>
            Basis: Directly observing the teachers and their students in the classroom environment is important for us to understand how the teacher would be using the app. This would go along well with the interview method as it would give a context to what the teachers expressed in the interviews. It is also likely the best data gathering method when it comes to young children, who would less apt to participate in a more formal data gathering process such as questionnaires or interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
            Recording Techniques: Digital video recordings would allow the most data to be extracted from the meeting. All data recording techniques will require the consent of the parents as well as their children (assent).
            </p>
            <p>
            Method: Using the sample of teachers acquired in the previous research, determine which of their classrooms can reasonably participate in a direct observation by having the teacher send out a consent request form to their parents/guardians. Perform the direct observation, recording data with whatever form of data recording was acceptable (ideally, video recordings would provide more information that might be missed in a direct observation). Perhaps we could have two observers per classroom to help with that...?
            </p>
            <p>
            Resources:
            One to two observers per classroom
            </p>

            <h2>Questionnaires</h2>
            <p>
            Population: Teachers, Parents
            </p>
            <p>
            Basis: Surveys would allow us to get a larger number of replies for more general questions, from teachers and parents (as the students are perhaps too young to do a survey).
            </p>
            <p>
            Recording Techniques: The data recording artifact in this case is just the questionnaire or survey itself.
            </p>
            <p>
            Method: While determining the population for the observations, we can determine parents of children who would interested in participating in the study. These parents could then be sent a survey/questionnaire (perhaps at the same time with the consent form from earlier). To make collection of data easier ( and quicker) we could have the survey/questionnaire done online. The data would be stored in a database where it could be retrieved and parsed for analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
            Resources:
            An individual to set up the survey and an individual to analyze the data (might be the same person).
            </p>
