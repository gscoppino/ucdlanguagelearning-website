We found through our data gathering that while we had a strong core vision for the application, we had not considered enough how exactly to design the app to be approachable and valuable for students in their learning, which would be a necessity in order to convince teachers and possibly even parents to use it. Because of this, our choice of using semi-structured interviews in our data gathering turned out to be well-grounded. When explaining our vision for the application, the teachers we interviewed expressed interest and overall approval of our plans. When we began discussing our application functions, though, we quickly got feedback from the teachers about specific functions we had not considered, and higher level goals we had not considered as well.


Our design goal is to make a language learning application that is intuitive and helpful to both students and teachers. To accomplish this goal, we decided to have the app have both content creation (for teachers) and language games (for students).


The idea of creating their own custom content was appealing to the teachers, and they expressed interest in potentially using this functionality to insert their own curriculum into the app, with their chosen set of words and challenges. This was a concept of content creation we hadn’t considered, that could be very helpful to teachers.


The teachers also were in agreement with having a game-like experience for the students, but gave us a fresh perspective on what that should entail. For one, we were reminded early on of the focus on education. The games should be fun for the students to play, but they should supplement and benefit the students education. It is absolutely possible to make a language game that doesn’t help the students properly learn the language in question. We learned that simply mapping words for a source language to a target language should not be anywhere near the core focus of the games. Rather, we want to get the students to think in the language they are learning, and to communicate effectively. For instance, it is more valuable to show a student a picture of a lamp, and ask them to describe it in the target language, then it is to ask them to translate the word lamp from the source language to the target language.


When it comes to games, we hadn’t given enough thought into actually making the games fun either! The teachers were helpful in providing ideas that would play on the student's natural competitiveness and desire for positive feedback. Among those ideas were scoreboards, time-based games, and puzzles. Also new game types were recommended, such as a game where a student is given a picture with multiple elements and they have to describe all the elements of the image. Such an idea tests the understanding of the student way more than word mappings can, and allows a teacher to get more out of a single piece of generated content, than, say, matching a picture to a sentence describing it.
